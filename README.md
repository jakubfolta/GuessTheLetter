## Sources
This project was inspired by "Invent your own computer games with Python" by Al Sweigart. 

## Inspiration 
This game is based on the "Guess the number" game. I wanted to create some other guessing game. While writing it I encountered some obstacles about which I had no idea in the beginning - like, choosing random letter (random.choice()) or replacing bad guess with dash in the aplhabet and showing it to the player at every turn.
